!!! IMPORTANT !!!

Starting 2024, the models used as the base for our custom models have since been deprecated. As such, the game is currently unplayable.

================================================================

This project is a text-based adventure game that uses custom GPT-3 models to expand the number of acceptable responses to a prompt. 

================================================================

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT


To run the provided final_bonnem3_hungj2_staplp2.py file locally, you must have OpenAI, which should include Panda, installed.  In a terminal (such as conda), run the rti.py Python script with your OpenAI API key as the first command line argument.   


To play the game, like most text-based adventure games, the player must type their response to given prompts provided by the game.  The game ends once the game no longer accepts user input, resulting in a “Game Over” text on failed runs whereas a successful run just stops accepting user input.  


To quit the game for the terminal version, you can quit like you would any other application (Ctrl+c).
